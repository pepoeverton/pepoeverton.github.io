Hey I hope you're doing well! So taking advance you're here, I'll try to introduce in a short way, let's go!

My name is Everton Nunes dan.. I'm 30 years old and I'm from Brazil (south of Brazil) in a city called Gravatai, besides my basic information, I'd like to say what I like and cool stuff, so I'm a software developer with almost +8 years of experience, I've been working on so many projects, since internal projects as dashboards, order monitor, social network for food, design system, investment platform and finally a food platform and in all of those projects I worked with so many technologies like TypeScript, React, Next.js, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS, Jest, Testing Library and a bunch of others.

I really like to work in an environment that I can be myself and feel free to be taught and teach someone, in other words, in a environment without ego and some hero syndrome.
