Hallo, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Everton, and I'm a software engineer originally from Brazil, currently living in Berlin, Germany. I have over 8 years of experience in the field, specializing in front-end development, but with a solid background in back-end technologies as well. <br/>

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with various technologies such as Angular, Vue, React (my favorite), Next.js, AWS, and more. I'm passionate about staying up to date with the latest industry trends and always improving my skills. <br/>

I've also had the privilege of leading technical teams in the past, which has given me valuable insights into project management and team leadership. I'm committed to delivering high-quality products that meet the needs of users and businesses alike. <br/>

When I'm not working, I enjoy taking pictures, drawing, or riding my bike. These hobbies help me recharge and stay inspired, which ultimately benefits my work as a software engineer. <br/>

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
